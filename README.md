## Introduction

This project uses an IR sensor with an Arduino to detect the presence of an obstacle. The IR sensor emits infrared light and detects the reflected light from an object. When an object is detected, the Arduino will perform a specific action, such as turning on an LED.

## Components

- Arduino Uno (or any compatible board)
- IR sensor module
- LED
- Jumper wires
